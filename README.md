# Resume-Automation-using-AI
This is a preliminary, automation project that I created completely using the guidance of AI in just 25 minutes. 
It allows you to update your resume dynamically in a google sheet, and get it reflected in your new request in the web page, where you'll choose the desired role for generating the resume. This uses the Google sheets API to interact with the the source data where you can update it easily.
